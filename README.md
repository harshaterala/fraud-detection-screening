# Fraud Detection - Screening Project

This repository contains an end-to-end fraud detection pipeline developed as part of a technical screening task.  
The project analyzes highly imbalanced financial transaction data and applies multiple machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- Handling extreme class imbalance.
- Training & evaluating:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- SHAP explainability for model interpretability.
- Visualizations for class distribution, feature importance, and ROC curves.

## ðŸ“Š Results
| Model               | Precision (Fraud) | Recall (Fraud) | ROC AUC |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.02              | 0.98           | 0.968   |
| Random Forest       | 0.71              | 0.88           | 0.938   |
| XGBoost             | 0.39              | 0.93           | 0.966   |

**Key Insight:** Random Forest achieved the best balance between precision and recall for fraud detection, with ROC AUC â‰ˆ 0.97.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
